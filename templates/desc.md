# Templates

Use templates to apply a curated set of configuration changes with a single click. Each template references the same options that appear throughout the rest of WinConfig, so running a template simply executes the underlying tweaks on your behalf.

- **Preview details** by selecting a template. The right-hand panel explains what it touches.
- **Apply** a template when you want to quickly match a predefined baseline.

The catalog will grow over time. For now, the **Windows Default** template enumerates every current option and restores it to the stock Windows value (or skips it when Windows has no meaningful revert). This makes it easy to undo earlier tweaks in a single pass.
